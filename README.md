## Automated Job Application Workflow (n8n + Google Gemini + Gmail + Google Sheets)
### Project Description

This project automates the end-to-end process of job discovery, evaluation, and application using n8n
.
The workflow runs daily, fetches job listings from LinkedIn RSS feeds, extracts relevant details with Google Gemini LLMs, evaluates suitability based on a candidate’s resume, generates personalized cover letters, and sends job applications via Gmail.
All processed jobs are also stored in Google Sheets for tracking.

✅ Job Match Scoring – Uses Gemini Model 2 to rate job fit against candidate’s skills/resume.
✅ Cover Letter Generation – Gemini Model 3 creates tailored cover letters per job.
